# Architecture Decisions

This document records accepted architectural decisions for the laboratory synchronization and acquisition framework.

This is a decision log, not the final architecture document.
The final `architecture.md` will be created later from accepted decisions.

---

## Decision 001: The GUI is a client

**Status:** Accepted

The GUI is a client of the synchronization and acquisition framework.

The GUI may define:

* enabled devices
* session parameters
* protocol choices
* user-facing commands

The GUI does not own:

* acquisition timing
* device synchronization
* raw data storage
* session reconstruction
* scientific timestamps

**Rationale:**
The framework must remain usable without a specific GUI implementation. Acquisition timing must remain close to the acquisition system, not the user interface.

**Consequence:**
GUI integration must occur through explicit commands and configuration handoff.

---

## Decision 002: GUI and Controller are conceptually separate

**Status:** Accepted

The GUI and Controller are separate architectural roles, even if they run on the same computer.

The GUI is responsible for user interaction.

The Controller is responsible for high-level session commands, such as:

* create session
* configure session
* start session
* stop session
* abort session

**Rationale:**
Separating GUI from Controller prevents user-interface code from becoming the session authority.

**Consequence:**
The framework should not assume that the GUI process is the same thing as the session command authority.

---

## Decision 003: The Jetson is an Acquisition Node

**Status:** Accepted

The Jetson is a hardware-facing Acquisition Node.

The Jetson owns:

* local hardware communication
* device adapters
* local device lifecycle during acquisition
* acquisition start/stop execution
* local timestamp capture
* forwarding data and events to the Ingestor

The Jetson does not own:

* global experiment design
* GUI logic
* long-term storage policy
* final session reconstruction
* neuroscience analysis

**Rationale:**
The Jetson should be the hardware-facing system, not the whole-system overlord.

**Consequence:**
The Jetson should remain replaceable by another acquisition node in the future.

---

## Decision 004: The Ingestor is a separate architectural entity

**Status:** Accepted

The Ingestor is an independent architectural entity.

It may run:

* on the GUI PC
* on a second laptop
* on the Jetson
* on a storage/server machine

The Ingestor owns:

* receiving data packets and events
* assigning ingest order
* preserving timing records
* validating completeness
* forwarding or writing data to storage
* recording packet arrival time for debugging

The Ingestor does not own:

* scientific time
* session time
* device lifecycle
* protocol execution
* GUI configuration

**Rationale:**
The legacy system blurred ingestion, timing, and storage. This framework separates those responsibilities.

**Consequence:**
Ingestor arrival time must never be treated as the scientific timestamp of a sample or event.

---

## Decision 005: Batch transfer is allowed, but does not define timing

**Status:** Accepted

Acquisition Nodes may transmit data in batches.

For example, the Jetson may send every 500 rows of acquired data to the Ingestor.

However, each row, sample, or event must already contain its timing information before batching.

**Accepted rule:**

```text
Acquire sample -> assign/capture timestamp -> batch -> ingest -> store
```

**Rejected rule:**

```text
Acquire sample -> batch -> ingest -> assign same arrival timestamp to all rows
```

**Rationale:**
Network or inter-process transfer timing is not the same as acquisition timing.

**Consequence:**
Batch size may affect latency, but it must not affect scientific timestamps.

---

## Decision 006: Session time has one owner

**Status:** Accepted

Session time is owned by the Synchronization Manager.

Session time is the shared experiment time used to align all streams and events.

The GUI does not own session time.
The Ingestor does not own session time.
Message queues do not own session time.
Storage does not own session time.

**Rationale:**
The legacy system had no explicit timing authority. This framework must have one.

**Consequence:**
Every stored sample or event must be traceable to session time.

---

## Decision 007: Phase 1 session time may use Jetson monotonic time

**Status:** Accepted

For the first version, session time may be based on the Jetson monotonic clock.

This is acceptable because:

* the most critical data are approximately 30 Hz
* millisecond-level precision is sufficient for the initial setup
* the Jetson is close to the acquisition hardware

Session time must not be based on:

* wall-clock time
* GUI time
* Ingestor arrival time
* Redis/message queue timestamps

**Rationale:**
An external hardware timing source is not required initially if Jetson monotonic time satisfies experimental precision.

**Consequence:**
The architecture must still allow future upgrade to hardware timing anchors if needed.

---

## Decision 008: External hardware timing remains a future-compatible option

**Status:** Accepted

The system should not require an external hardware timing source in Phase 1.

However, the architecture must allow future timing sources, such as:

* hardware pulse trains
* frame counters
* DAQ counters
* TTL synchronization signals
* external clock sources

**Rationale:**
The first system should not be overbuilt, but the architecture should not prevent stronger synchronization later.

**Consequence:**
The Synchronization Manager should be defined conceptually as owning session time, not as being permanently tied to one specific clock source.

---

## Decision 009: Devices may keep local clocks, but local clocks are not session time

**Status:** Accepted

Devices may produce local timestamps, counters, frame numbers, or sample indices.

These local timing records should be preserved when available.

However, local device time is not the same as session time.

**Rationale:**
Device-local time is useful for debugging, reconstruction, and drift detection, but it cannot be treated as the shared experiment clock unless explicitly mapped.

**Consequence:**
Stored data should distinguish clearly between:

* session time
* device local time
* ingest time

---

## Decision 010: Every data row or event must have session time

**Status:** Accepted

Every acquired data row, sample, frame, or event must have a session timestamp or a defined way to reconstruct one.

This is mandatory, not optional.

**Rationale:**
The most important scientific information is the data and when the data happened.

**Consequence:**
Data without timing is incomplete data.

---

## Decision 011: Timing records are part of the raw scientific record

**Status:** Accepted

Timing records are not secondary metadata.

They are part of the raw scientific record.

Timing records include, when applicable:

* sample timestamp
* frame timestamp
* event timestamp
* frame index
* sample index
* device local timestamp
* device local counter
* packet number
* batch number
* dropped-frame flag
* dropped-sample flag
* session start time
* session stop time
* synchronization anchor records
* local-to-session time mapping records

**Rationale:**
If timing records are lost, the session may not be scientifically reconstructable.

**Consequence:**
Timing records must be stored with the same seriousness as behavioral or neural data.

---

## Decision 012: Ingest time is stored for debugging, not scientific alignment

**Status:** Accepted

The Ingestor should record when it received packets or events.

This time is useful for:

* debugging latency
* detecting network delays
* detecting stalled devices
* auditing data transfer

Ingest time should not be used as the scientific acquisition time unless explicitly justified for a specific device or event type.

**Rationale:**
Arrival time is affected by batching, buffering, scheduling, and network delays.

**Consequence:**
Ingest time and session time must be stored as separate concepts.

---

## Decision 013: Offline reconstruction is mandatory

**Status:** Accepted

A complete session must be reconstructable from stored raw data and stored timing records.

Online synchronization may be useful, but it is not sufficient.

**Rationale:**
If reconstruction depends on transient runtime state that was not stored, the session is fragile and difficult to audit.

**Consequence:**
The system must store enough information to rebuild the session timeline after acquisition has ended.

---

## Decision 014: Device Adapter and Device Manager are separate concepts

**Status:** Accepted

A Device Adapter handles device-specific communication.

A Device Manager handles device lifecycle.

Device Adapter responsibilities include:

* communicating with a specific device type
* exposing device capabilities
* receiving device data
* issuing device commands
* reporting device status

Device Manager responsibilities include:

* device discovery
* device initialization
* device configuration
* arming devices
* starting devices
* stopping devices
* shutting devices down
* collecting health/status reports

**Rationale:**
Device-specific communication should not be mixed with whole-session lifecycle coordination.

**Consequence:**
Adding a new device should usually require a new adapter, not changes to orchestration logic.

---

## Decision 015: Device roles should use a common conceptual interface

**Status:** Accepted

The orchestration layer should not care whether a device is a camera, speaker, lick sensor, accelerometer, water port, or future device.

Devices should expose capabilities rather than biological meaning.

Examples of capabilities:

* produces stream
* produces events
* accepts commands
* accepts triggers
* provides local timestamps
* reports health
* produces files
* consumes protocol events

**Rationale:**
The system must be modular and extensible.

**Consequence:**
Device-specific meaning should live in adapters and configuration, not in the orchestration layer.

---

## Decision 016: Configuration must be explicit and propagated

**Status:** Accepted

Runtime behavior must be controlled by explicit configuration, not hidden function defaults.

The architecture should support explicit configuration for:

* session parameters
* device parameters
* synchronization parameters
* storage parameters
* protocol parameters

**Rationale:**
The legacy system allowed wrappers to hide lower-level function parameters, causing defaults to be used unintentionally.

**Consequence:**
Important runtime parameters should be represented in explicit configuration objects or files and passed through the system.

---

## Decision 017: Intermediate outputs should be human-readable

**Status:** Accepted

Intermediate outputs should remain human-readable and easy to debug.

NWB should be supported as a final scientific output, but NWB should not be the only stored/debuggable format.

**Rationale:**
During acquisition and debugging, researchers need to inspect intermediate data and timing records directly.

**Consequence:**
The storage architecture should support both debugging-friendly records and later NWB export.

---

## Decision 018: Storage should follow NWB logic where appropriate

**Status:** Accepted

The internal data model should be compatible with NWB concepts where practical.

This does not mean that every intermediate file must be NWB.

It means that device records, time series, events, metadata, and session structure should be organized in a way that makes later NWB export natural.

**Rationale:**
Final scientific output should support NWB, and early data modeling choices should not make NWB export difficult.

**Consequence:**
The storage model should avoid ad hoc structures that cannot be mapped cleanly to scientific data objects.

---

## Decision 019: The repository is for synchronization and acquisition

**Status:** Accepted

This repository is for the synchronization and acquisition framework.

It is not:

* a GUI repository
* a neuroscience analysis repository
* a plotting-first repository
* a one-off experiment script repository

**Rationale:**
Clear repository scope prevents architectural drift.

**Consequence:**
GUI code, analysis pipelines, and experiment-specific scripts should remain outside the core unless they are needed for framework validation.

---

## Decision 020: Utilities are allowed but must not become a junk drawer

**Status:** Accepted

A `utils` area may exist, but only for genuinely cross-cutting helpers that do not belong to a domain-specific component.

Domain-specific logic should live with its domain.

For example:

```text
sync/time_mapping
```

is preferred over:

```text
utils/time_helpers
```

when the logic belongs to synchronization.

**Rationale:**
Large utility folders often hide architectural boundaries.

**Consequence:**
Before adding something to utilities, decide whether it belongs to a named architectural component.

---

## Decision 021: Plotting is allowed only for framework debugging and validation

**Status:** Accepted

The repository may include plotting tools needed to validate acquisition, timing, synchronization, and reconstruction.

The repository should not become a neuroscience analysis or publication-figure repository.

**Rationale:**
Some plotting is necessary to debug timing and acquisition quality, but analysis plotting belongs elsewhere.

**Consequence:**
Plotting should focus on system validation, such as:

* timestamp spacing
* dropped frames
* stream alignment
* sync anchor visualization
* session reconstruction checks

---

## Decision 022: Source structure is not finalized yet

**Status:** Accepted

The final source tree is not yet decided.

Provisional architectural boundaries include:

* core session model
* devices
* acquisition
* synchronization
* ingestion
* storage
* reconstruction
* export
* protocols
* configuration
* constants
* utilities
* validation plotting
* tests

These boundaries should guide discussion, but they should not yet be treated as final implementation structure.

**Rationale:**
The architecture is still being decided.

**Consequence:**
The repository may contain placeholder folders, but production code should not begin until the major architectural boundaries are accepted.
